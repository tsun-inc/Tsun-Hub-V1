Exploiting or cheating is unfair to all Roblox players and creates a poor experience for everyone. These actions are a violation of the Roblox Terms of Use, and will lead to the deletion of an account.

Many exploits are scams to get you to download malware, such as a keylogger or other phishing program that can be used to steal personal information you have on your computer, including your Roblox password. Don't exploit; it's not worth it. 

If you see someone asking for passwords or other personal information, posting offsite links, attempting to exploit, or sharing exploits, please use the Report Abuse buttons located throughout the site and in every experience menu. Reporting allows our Moderators to remove the content and moderate the accounts for these rule violations.
